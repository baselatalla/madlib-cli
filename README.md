# LAB: File IO and Exceptions



## Problem Domain: 
creating a command line application which takes advantage of Pythonâ€™s built in capabilities for reading and writing files.
* Print a welcome message to the user, explaining the Madlib process and command line interactions
* Read a template Madlib file (Example), and parse that file into usable parts.
* Prompt the user to submit a series of words to fit each of the required components of the Madlib template.
*With the collected user inputs, populate the template such that each provided input is placed into the correct  position within the template.
* After the resulting Madlib has been completed, provide the completed response back to the user in the command line.
* Write the completed text (Example)to a new file on your file system (in the repo).
* Note: A smaller example file is included as well which can be handy when developing/testing.
